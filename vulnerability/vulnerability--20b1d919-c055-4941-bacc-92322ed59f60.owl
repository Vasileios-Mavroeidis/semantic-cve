A bypass of CVE-2020-26231 (fixed in 1.0.470/471 and 1.1.1) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-26231 & CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2. As a workaround, apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/f63519ff1e8d375df30deba63156a2fc97aa9ee7 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2."}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#modified": [{"@value": "2021-05-04T00:18:52.863337Z"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#created": [{"@value": "2021-05-04T00:18:52.863337Z"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#spec_version": [{"@value": "2.1"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#id": [{"@value": "vulnerability--20b1d919-c055-4941-bacc-92322ed59f60"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#name": [{"@value": "CVE-2021-21264"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#created_by_ref": [{"@id": "http://docs.oasis-open.org/tac/ns/stix-cve#identity--8ce3f695-d5a4-4dc8-9e93-a65af453a31a"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/marking#object_marking_refs": [{"@id": "http://docs.oasis-open.org/tac/ns/stix-cve#marking-definition--62fd3f9b-15f3-4ebc-802c-91fce9536bcf"}]}
