NOTE: since this issue, as described by the original researcher, is entirely dependent on the presence of another vulnerability, it could be argued that Wimpy cannot be responsible for how its data file is processed by applications outside of its control. Since this issue might only be useful as a facilitator manipulation in another vulnerability, perhaps it should not be included in CVE."}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#modified": [{"@value": "2021-03-13T20:10:35.584672Z"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#created": [{"@value": "2021-03-13T20:10:35.584672Z"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#spec_version": [{"@value": "2.1"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#id": [{"@value": "vulnerability--466c2a78-9684-444d-b2cb-c1e9d15c3214"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#name": [{"@value": "CVE-2006-0787"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#created_by_ref": [{"@id": "http://docs.oasis-open.org/tac/ns/stix-cve#identity--8ce3f695-d5a4-4dc8-9e93-a65af453a31a"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/marking#object_marking_refs": [{"@id": "http://docs.oasis-open.org/tac/ns/stix-cve#marking-definition--62fd3f9b-15f3-4ebc-802c-91fce9536bcf"}]}
