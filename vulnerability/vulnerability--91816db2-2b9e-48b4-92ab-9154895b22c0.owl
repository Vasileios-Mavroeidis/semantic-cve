This framework requires these packets to be passed. By continuously sending any of these types of formatted genuine packets, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing a sustained Denial of Service. Authentication to the BGP peer is not required. This issue can be initiated or propagated through eBGP and iBGP and can impact devices in either modes of use as long as the devices are configured to support the compromised framework and a BGP path is activated or active.
