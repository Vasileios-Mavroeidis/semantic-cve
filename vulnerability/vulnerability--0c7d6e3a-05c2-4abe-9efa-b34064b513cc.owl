The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third-party app, utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a phone number, factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video, install applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack."}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#modified": [{"@value": "2021-03-13T20:13:36.002243Z"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#created": [{"@value": "2021-03-13T20:13:36.002243Z"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#spec_version": [{"@value": "2.1"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#id": [{"@value": "vulnerability--0c7d6e3a-05c2-4abe-9efa-b34064b513cc"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#name": [{"@value": "CVE-2016-10138"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/core#created_by_ref": [{"@id": "http://docs.oasis-open.org/tac/ns/stix-cve#identity--8ce3f695-d5a4-4dc8-9e93-a65af453a31a"}], "http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/ns/stix/marking#object_marking_refs": [{"@id": "http://docs.oasis-open.org/tac/ns/stix-cve#marking-definition--62fd3f9b-15f3-4ebc-802c-91fce9536bcf"}]}
