The interface does not recover on its own and the FPC must be reset manually. Continued receipt and processing of these frames will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue is platform-specific and affects the following platforms and line cards: * MPC7E/8E/9E and MPC10E on MX240, MX480, MX960, MX2008, MX2010, and MX2020 * MX204, MX10003, MX10008, MX10016 * EX9200, EX9251 * SRX4600 No other products or platforms are affected by this vulnerability.
