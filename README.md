## Introduction

This repository hosts the **Semantic Representation (version)** of the Vulnerability objects (in that case CVEs) published in the [STIX Common Objects Repository](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects) of the [OASIS CTI TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti).

* The Vulnerability **objects** that are part of the [STIX Common Objects Repository](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects) of the OASIS CTI TC enumerate the published CVE list using the STIX 2.1 Standard and, in particular, the Vulnerability SDO.

* The vulnerability **facts** in this repository provide the semantic represetation of the [STIX Vulnerability Objects](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects/tree/main/objects/vulnerability) of the OASIS CTI TC. The semantic representation of the STIX Vulnerability objects is based on the STIX 2.1 Standard and, in particular, the semantic representation of the Vulnerability SDO as represented in the [TAC/STIX Ontology of the OASIS TAC TC](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/tac-ontology).

## Operationalizing the Facts of this Repo

The facts (.owl files) in this repository are aligned to the [Ontological Representation of the STIX Standard](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/tac-ontology) as published by the [OASIS Standards Committee - Threat Actor Context](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/tac-ontology).

**To Operationalize this work:**

* Follow the information provided in the [TAC TC Repo that offers the Ontological Representation of the STIX Standard](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/tac-ontology).

## Note
The knowledge base provided in this repository will be forwarded to the official [OASIS TC Open Repositories GitHub](https://github.com/oasis-open) and will be maintained by the [OASIS Threat Actor Context Technical Committee (TAC TC)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tac). The University of Oslo offers the resources needed to automate the process. The information in this GitHub repository will be updated to reflect that change.
